# Butterfly-Neopixel-Bluetooth-Controller
Arduino code to control a string of neopixels. 
Recives bluetooth commands to recive palettes, and change settings.

Commands can be sent for my app.
App included in download as apk. Android Only :(

Google play:

IOS version will be available when apple stops being so proprietary, and simply accepts MIT app inventer's apps; or allows third party instalations. Sorry, nothing i can do.
